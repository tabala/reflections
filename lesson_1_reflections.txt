1. How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

I could see the changes in the terminal.

2. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You can see all the changes that have been made in the file, if you screw up your code you can back up to the previous working version

3. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

4. Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

5. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log --stat - How many lines have been changed.
git diff -- gives you all the differences between two comits
git checkout - previous commit
git init - initialie git repository
